              <b> Sea Turtles</b> scientifically named as <i>Chelonioidea</i> are a group of reptiles adapted to living in the marine environment. Sea turtles have streamlined bodies that help them swim efficiently in water. They have protective shells and can migrate long distances. Their limbs are flippers, which they use for swimming and steering. Sea turtles have a special way of breathing that lets them stay underwater for a long time. They mate in the sea and lay eggs on beaches. These amazing creatures can be found in all oceans except the polar regions.

                  Sea turtles are vital for healthy oceans. They are known as "keystone species" because they play a crucial role in their environment and affect other species. Removing a keystone species can disturb the natural balance and impact other wildlife and plants in various ways. Sea turtles provide a habitat for various organisms like barnacles, small crustaceans, remoras, algae, and diatoms. Their long migrations help transport these species. Additionally, sea turtles act as a shelter for fish, protecting them from predators.

                  Sea turtles are vital to coastal communities worldwide, with cultural significance and revered as ancestors by indigenous cultures. They also boost the income of coastal residents through turtle-watching ecotourism. Apart from their ecological role, sea turtles are adored for their charm. Watching them nest, swim, or witness hatchlings reaching the sea is enchanting and unforgettable. Sea turtles are essential for our planet, completing our oceans.
