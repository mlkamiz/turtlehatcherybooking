This adaptation enables them to find food sources in hard to reach crack and crevices. They are the only sea turtle species with the ability to survive on a diet consisting mainly of sponges. They can also be identified by their distincitve overlapping scale pattern that from a serrated looking edge.Furthermore they have a pair of claws adorning each flipper. Male hawksbills have longer claws, thicker tails, and somewhat brighter coloring than females. <br><br> They are found throughout the globes's tropical oceans mainly in coral reefs.Hawksbills grow up to 2 to 3 feet in shell length and can weigh between 100 and 150 pounds at maturity while hatchlings are only 2 to 3 inches long and mostly brown in color. Hawksbills are estimated to reach maturity between 20 to 35 years of age, depending upon a variety of factors, especially resource availability.They are solitary for most of their lives and meet only to mate</p></th>

            <th><h3><u>Description</u></h3><br><br><p>Loggerhead turtles are named after their large heads which accommodate highly powerful jaw muscles that enable them to take hard-shelled prey such as sea urchins and clams as their primary foor source. The way these turtles eat their hard-shelled food recycles crucial nutrients and helps maintain the equilibrium of the sediments on the ocean floor. In adults and sub-adults, the top shell is somewhat heart-shaped and reddish-brown, while the bottom shell is often a pale yellowish tint. Typically, the top of the neck and the bottom of the flippers have a medium to pale yellow color and a dull to reddish brown color, respectively. <br><br>The most prevalent type of turtle in the Mediterranean is the loggerhead, which breeds on beaches from Greece and Turkey to Libya.Loggerhead sea turtles have a lengthy lifespan of up to 80 years. About 35 years old is the maturation age for female loggerheads. They mate in coastal seas every two to three years and then come back to nest on a beach.</p></th>

They can reach lengths of upto 1.8 metres and also easily weigh over 500Kg. Its absence of a bony shell and a body coated in oily flesh and flexible, leather-like skin, after which it is named, immediately set it apart from other contemporary sea turtles.Also they have the most hydrodynamic body of any sea turtle, with a large, teardrop-shaped body. A large pair of front flippers powers the turtles through the water.<br><br>The leatherback turtle has the widest global distribution of any reptile,and it mostly breeds on beaches in tropical or subtropical climates.Leatherback turtles consume large numbers of jellyfish which helps to keep populations of these marine organisms in check.Compared to hard-shelled turtles, leatherback turtles develop more quickly. The exact age at which they become sexually mature is not known, though. Age ranges from 9 to 20 on average, according to estimates.Although their life expectancy is unknown, it is believed that they can live for 45 to 50 years or beyond.</p></th>

Being herbivorous and mostly consuming seagrasses and algae sets them apart from other sea turtles. Their name derives from the color of their fat, which is green due to their diet.They feature a pair of massive, paddle-like flippers on either side of their dorsoventrally flattened body, which is protected by a gigantic, teardrop-shaped shell. Green turtle adults may reach a length of 1.5 meters and weigh, on average, between 68 and 190 kilograms.However exceptional specimens can weigh 315 kg or even more, with the largest known one having weighed 395 kg and measured 153 cm in length.<br><br>Green turtles are found throughout the world, but are most common in subtropical and temperate regions of the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, and Mediterranean Oceans, as well as in the Mediterranean Sea.Many islands around the world are known as Turtle Islands due to green sea turtles nesting on their beaches. The adults typically inhabit shallow lagoons, feeding primarily on various species of seagrass.The average lifespan of a green turtle is at least 70 years, if not more. Green turtle females mature between 25 and 35 years of age.</p></th>

The species is the most prevalent and second-smallest sea turtle in the world. An olive ridley's four flippers each have one or two claws.The tiniest sea turtle, the olive ridley, may weigh up to 100 pounds and only has a shell length of around 2 feet. <br><br> The olive ridley turtle inhabits tropical and warm seas of the Pacific and Indian Oceans from India, Arabia, Japan, and Micronesia south to southern Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. It has a circumtropical range. They probably live a long time, much like other sea turtles do. Around 14 years old is the maturation age for olive ridleys. One of the most unusual nesting behaviors in the natural world is shown by the olive ridley sea turtle.  Off the coast of nesting beaches, enormous numbers of turtles congregate. Then, all at once, a sizable number of turtles arrive at the coast to lay their eggs in what is known as a "arribada," which is Spanish for "arrival." Hundreds to thousands of females come ashore to deposit their eggs during these arribadas.</p></th>
